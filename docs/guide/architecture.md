# Architecture

Checkgate has three main layers: the **control plane** (server), the **evaluation core** (Rust library), and the **SDK clients**.

## Overview

## Data Model

The server organizes data in a strict four-level hierarchy:

```
Workspace  (singleton — one per installation)
  └── Projects
        ├── project_members (project_id, user_id, role)
        └── Environments
              ├── sdk_keys   (environment_id FK)
              ├── flags      (environment_id FK)
              └── impressions (environment_id FK)
```

An SDK key is tied to one environment. When a client authenticates, the server uses the key to resolve both the project and the environment — no `project_id` or `environment_id` needs to be passed separately in the SDK.

## Control Plane (Server)

The server is a single Rust binary built with **Axum**. It is responsible for:

- Storing projects, environments, flags, and users durably in **PostgreSQL**
- Maintaining an in-memory `FlagStore` for fast SSE bootstrap
- Exposing a **REST API** for CRUD operations (project- and environment-scoped)
- Broadcasting flag changes to connected SDKs via **SSE** (`/stream`), scoped per environment
- Publishing change events to **Redis** pub/sub for multi-instance deployments
- Tracking flag evaluation events (**impressions**) from SDK clients

### Write Path

When a flag is created or updated:

1. The REST API handler writes the flag to **PostgreSQL**
2. It publishes an `UPSERT` event (with `env_id`) to the `checkgate_updates` **Redis** channel
3. The server's own Redis subscriber receives the event and updates the local in-memory `FlagStore`
4. Connected SSE clients whose SDK key matches the flag's `environment_id` receive the event

> The in-memory store is updated via the Redis subscriber loop, not directly by the write handler. This ensures the same code path runs for both local writes and cross-instance propagation.

### Multi-Instance Deployments

When running multiple Checkgate server instances behind a load balancer:

- Each instance subscribes to Redis pub/sub on startup
- A write to any instance propagates to all others via Redis
- All instances stay in sync without direct inter-node communication

## API Routes

Routes are organized by scope:

```
# Projects (workspace admin only for mutations)
GET     /api/projects
POST    /api/projects
PATCH   /api/projects/{project_id}
DELETE  /api/projects/{project_id}

# Project members
GET     /api/projects/{project_id}/members
POST    /api/projects/{project_id}/members
PATCH   /api/projects/{project_id}/members/{user_id}
DELETE  /api/projects/{project_id}/members/{user_id}

# Environments (project-scoped)
GET     /api/projects/{project_id}/environments
POST    /api/projects/{project_id}/environments
PATCH   /api/projects/{project_id}/environments/{env_id}
DELETE  /api/projects/{project_id}/environments/{env_id}

# SDK Keys (project-scoped, environment-targeted)
GET     /api/projects/{project_id}/keys
POST    /api/projects/{project_id}/keys          body: { name, environment_id }
DELETE  /api/projects/{project_id}/keys/{id}

# Flags (environment-scoped)
GET/POST         /api/environments/{env_id}/flags
GET/PATCH/DELETE /api/environments/{env_id}/flags/{key}
POST             /api/environments/{env_id}/flags/{key}/promote

# Impressions
GET  /api/environments/{env_id}/impressions       ?flag_key= &user_id= &value= &since_id=
GET  /api/environments/{env_id}/impressions/stats
POST /api/environments/{env_id}/impressions
```

## Evaluation Core (`checkgate-core`)

The core is a Rust library (`core/`) compiled into each SDK:

- **`FlagStore`** — thread-safe `DashMap` holding the in-memory flag cache
- **`evaluate(flag, user_context)`** — pure function, no I/O, no allocations on the hot path

### Evaluation Logic

```
isEnabled(flag_key, user_key, attributes)
    │
    ├── Flag not found → false
    ├── flag.is_enabled == false → false
    │
    ├── Targeting rules (first match wins)
    │   └── rule.attribute ∈ attributes AND operator matches → true
    │
    └── Rollout percentage
        ├── 0% → false
        ├── 100% → true
        └── MurmurHash3(flag_key + ":" + user_key) % 100 < percentage → true/false
```

Targeting rules bypass the rollout percentage. A user matching a targeting rule always gets `true`, even if the rollout is 0%.

### Hashing

Rollout uses **MurmurHash3** (x86/32-bit) for:
- **Speed** — non-cryptographic, very fast
- **Stability** — same user + flag always maps to the same bucket
- **Distribution** — uniform bucketing across the 0–99 range

## SSE Stream

The SSE stream (`GET /stream`) connects SDK clients to the server for real-time flag updates. It is **scoped per environment**.

### Environment Scoping via SDK Key

Each SDK key is stored with an `environment_id` in the database. When a client connects:

1. The server resolves the SDK key to an `environment_id`
2. It bootstraps the client with only the flags belonging to that environment (queried from PostgreSQL)
3. All subsequent live events are filtered to that `environment_id`

This means a single Checkgate installation can serve multiple projects with multiple environments, with each SDK client receiving only the flags relevant to its environment.

### Connection Lifecycle

1. SDK connects to `GET /stream` with `Authorization: Bearer sk_live_...`
2. Server looks up the key → resolves `environment_id`
3. Server sends `connected` event — SDK clears its local store
4. Server bootstraps the SDK by replaying all current flags for that environment
5. Server sends `keep-alive` pings every 15 seconds
6. On flag change, only clients in the matching environment receive the update
7. On reconnect, the SDK clears its local store and re-bootstraps from scratch

### Events

| Event | Payload | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `connected` | `"true"` | Connection established; SDK resets its store |
| `update` | JSON string | A flag was upserted or deleted in this environment |
| (keep-alive) | `keep-alive-text` | Heartbeat every 15 seconds |

## Authentication

Two separate authentication mechanisms:

| Credential | Used by | How |
|------------|---------|-----|
| Email + password | Dashboard users | Issues an HttpOnly AES-256-GCM encrypted session cookie |
| SDK key (`sk_live_...`) | SDK clients, CI/CD | `Authorization: Bearer <key>` or `?sdk_key=` query param |

SDK keys are stored in PostgreSQL, managed per-project from the **Project Settings → SDK Keys** tab. Each key is bound to one environment — it implicitly identifies both the project and the environment for all API calls and the SSE stream.

### Role Enforcement

| Route category | Required role |
|---|---|
| Read flags, impressions | Any authenticated user with project access |
| Write flags | `editor` or `admin` (project member) |
| Manage environments, SDK keys, project members | `admin` (project member) |
| Manage workspace users, create/delete projects | Workspace `admin` |

Workspace admins bypass all per-project membership checks.

## Impression Tracking

SDKs report evaluation events asynchronously:

```
POST /api/environments/{env_id}/impressions
Authorization: Bearer <sdk_key>

[{"flag_key": "checkout_v2", "user_id": "u123", "value": "true", "context": {...}}]
```

Impressions are stored in the `impressions` table (indexed by `environment_id`, `flag_key`, `evaluated_at`). The dashboard surfaces them on two tabs:

- **Analytics** — per-flag aggregates: total evaluations, true/false split, unique users
- **Stream** — live polling log (refreshes every 3s), filterable by `flag_key`, `user_id`, and `value`; context JSON expandable inline

The `GET /api/environments/{env_id}/impressions` endpoint supports `since_id` for efficient incremental polling — the stream tab uses this to fetch only new rows since the last poll.

## SDK Clients

Each SDK maintains its own local copy of the flag store:

| SDK | Binding | Binary |
|-----|---------|--------|
| Node.js | NAPI-RS | `.node` native addon |
| Browser | wasm-bindgen | `.wasm` + JS glue |
| React Native | C FFI via JSI | `.so` / `.dylib` |
| Flutter | `dart:ffi` | `.so` / `.dylib` |

The SDK key passed at initialization determines which project and environment the client receives. No project ID or environment ID needs to be specified separately in the SDK — the key encodes that association server-side.
