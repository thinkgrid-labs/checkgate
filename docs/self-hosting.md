# Self-Hosting

Checkgate is designed to be self-hosted. The all-in-one Docker image bundles PostgreSQL, Redis, the server, and the dashboard into a single container — no external services required.

## Docker Compose (Recommended)

The simplest way to run Checkgate is with the provided `docker-compose.yml`:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This starts a single container that includes:
- **PostgreSQL** — persistent flag and user storage
- **Redis** — pub/sub for real-time multi-instance sync
- **Checkgate server** — REST API + SSE stream on port `3000`
- **React dashboard** — served at `http://localhost:3000`

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
SESSION_SECRET=your-random-64-char-secret   # Required in production
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=strong-db-password        # Replaces default "checkgate"
COOKIE_SECURE=true                          # Set false only for local HTTP development
```

Then run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Docker Images

One image is published per release:

| Image | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `ghcr.io/thinkgrid-labs/checkgate:latest` | All-in-one: PostgreSQL + Redis + server + dashboard |
| `ghcr.io/thinkgrid-labs/checkgate:<version>` | Pinned version (e.g. `1.2.0`) |

The image is multi-architecture: `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SESSION_SECRET` | _(insecure dev key)_ | Secret for encrypting session cookies. Use a random ≥32-char string in production. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `postgres://checkgate:password@localhost/checkgate` | PostgreSQL connection string (used when not using bundled PG) |
| `REDIS_URL` | `redis://localhost:6379` | Redis connection string (used when not using bundled Redis) |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | `checkgate` | Password for the bundled PostgreSQL instance |
| `POSTGRES_USER` | `checkgate` | Username for the bundled PostgreSQL instance |
| `POSTGRES_DB` | `checkgate` | Database name for the bundled PostgreSQL instance |
| `COOKIE_SECURE` | `true` | Set `false` for local HTTP development. Controls the `Secure` cookie flag. |
| `SDK_KEY` | _(unset)_ | Legacy env var: adds an extra accepted SDK key without a DB entry |
| `PUBLIC_DIR` | `public` | Directory to serve dashboard static files from |
| `PORT` | `3000` | Port the server listens on |
| `DB_MAX_CONNECTIONS` | `10` | PostgreSQL connection pool size |
| `RUST_LOG` | `info` | Log level (`error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, `trace`) |

### Security

Always set `SESSION_SECRET` in production. Without it, session cookies use a hardcoded dev key that is public knowledge — anyone can forge sessions.

```bash
# Generate a secure session secret
openssl rand -hex 32
```

SDK keys are managed through the dashboard Settings page. The first key is auto-generated on first boot. Additional keys can be created and revoked without restarting the server.

## External PostgreSQL and Redis

To use your own PostgreSQL and Redis instead of the bundled ones, run the image directly and pass the connection strings:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 \
  -e DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:password@your-postgres:5432/checkgate" \
  -e REDIS_URL="redis://your-redis:6379" \
  -e SESSION_SECRET="your-secret" \
  ghcr.io/thinkgrid-labs/checkgate:latest
```

## AWS

### EC2 Deployment

1. Launch an EC2 instance (t3.micro is sufficient for most workloads)
2. Install Docker:
   ```bash
   sudo yum update -y && sudo yum install -y docker
   sudo systemctl start docker
   ```
3. Set up RDS PostgreSQL and ElastiCache Redis (optional — use the bundled versions for simpler setups)
4. Create a `.env` file:
   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@rds-endpoint:5432/checkgate
   REDIS_URL=redis://elasticache-endpoint:6379
   SESSION_SECRET=your-random-secret
   COOKIE_SECURE=true
   ```
5. Run:
   ```bash
   docker run -d --env-file .env -p 3000:3000 \
     ghcr.io/thinkgrid-labs/checkgate:latest
   ```

### ECS (Fargate)

A basic task definition:

```json
{
  "family": "checkgate",
  "networkMode": "awsvpc",
  "requiresCompatibilities": ["FARGATE"],
  "cpu": "256",
  "memory": "512",
  "containerDefinitions": [
    {
      "name": "checkgate",
      "image": "ghcr.io/thinkgrid-labs/checkgate:latest",
      "portMappings": [{"containerPort": 3000}],
      "environment": [
        {"name": "DATABASE_URL", "value": "postgres://..."},
        {"name": "REDIS_URL", "value": "redis://..."},
        {"name": "SESSION_SECRET", "value": "your-random-secret"},
        {"name": "COOKIE_SECURE", "value": "true"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Load Balancing

Checkgate is stateless — the in-memory flag store is rebuilt from PostgreSQL on startup and kept in sync via Redis pub/sub. Run as many instances as you need behind an ALB.

**Important**: The SSE stream (`/stream`) requires sticky sessions or a long-lived HTTP/2 connection. Configure your ALB target group with:
- **Protocol**: HTTP/1.1 (SSE is not compatible with HTTP/2 connection multiplexing on ALB)
- **Stickiness**: Enabled (duration-based, any duration)

Or rely on **Redis pub/sub fan-out** (built-in): all instances subscribe to Redis and will forward updates to their connected SDK clients regardless of which instance received the API write.

## Health Checks

The server exposes a health check endpoint:

```http
GET /health
```

Returns `200 OK` with body `OK`. Use this for load balancer and container health checks (as configured in the Dockerfile's `HEALTHCHECK` instruction).

## Upgrading

Checkgate uses [sqlx migrations](https://docs.rs/sqlx/latest/sqlx/macro.migrate.html) that run automatically on startup. To upgrade:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/thinkgrid-labs/checkgate:latest
docker compose up -d --force-recreate
```

The server applies any new migrations before accepting traffic. Existing data is preserved.

## Backup

Back up your PostgreSQL database using standard tooling:

```bash
pg_dump -h localhost -U checkgate checkgate > checkgate-backup.sql
```

Redis is used only for pub/sub message passing and does not need to be backed up — no durable state is stored there.
